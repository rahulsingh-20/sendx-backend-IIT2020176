## About the project

I have attempted the backend-heavy assignment, which crawls webpages for paying and non-paying customers. It uses goroutines to create multiple workers to crawl pages concurrently, and the number of these workers can be changed via an API exposed by the server.

<ul>
Project features:
  <li>Uses goroutines to achieve concurrent programming to crawl multiple pages at the same time.</li>
  <li>Different number of worker threads for paying and non-paying customers, which can be changed and viewed through an API exposed by the backend application.</li>
  <li>Features proper error handling and commented code</li>
</ul>
